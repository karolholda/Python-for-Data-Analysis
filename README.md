## 💡 Summary of Insights

- **High rating (5) is better than lower rating**: However, no rating doesn't mean no return, quite the opposite usually.
- **As gross sales increase, net sales also increase**: Net sales and gross sales over time
- **Reconsider discounts**: Yearly summary. Costs lower than gross sales but higher than net sales.
