# 🏃 Athlete Performance Analysis Project

This project explores performance trends and insights in long-distance running events, focusing on athlete demographics, race characteristics, and seasonal impacts. By analyzing data such as race distances, athlete gender, age, average speeds, and seasonal variations, the study identifies patterns and factors influencing performance.

The findings provide actionable insights for race organizers to optimize event planning and for athletes to improve their training and performance strategies.

## 💡 Summary of Insights

- **Gender-Based Speed Trends**: Male athletes exhibit slightly higher average speeds than females in both 50km and 50mi races.  
- **Top Performing Age Groups**: Athletes aged 29-35 demonstrate the best average speeds in 50mi races with sufficient participation.  
- **Seasonal Impact**: Spring and Winter races are associated with faster average speeds, whereas Summer races experience slower speeds due to weather conditions.  
- **Age and Performance Correlation**: A negative correlation between age and speed indicates younger athletes generally run faster.  
- **Seasonal Participation**: Fall sees the highest participation rates, likely due to favorable weather conditions and race scheduling.  
- **Opportunities for Race Organizers**: Optimize race schedules for Spring and Fall and promote targeted training programs for various age groups.
